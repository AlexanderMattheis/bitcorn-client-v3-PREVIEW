# BITCORN
The idea of Bitcorn is to create an interactive, 
free learning platform using TypeScript and video-tutorials from YouTube.
It was formerly created to test out the Ember Framework
and modern webpage implementations. 

On that website you can also download creations like vector-graphics,
fonts and textures. Everything is free, so you have not to pay any licence fees. 
Even you have not to mention the author's name because everything 
except the logos and videos were released under the 
[CC0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
