  The correct dates of wood pieces can be determined by annual rings.
  Therefore, one can just measure the widths or maximum densities of individual rings
  and then shift them in a chronology with known dates to determine the exact calendar year.
  But such established approaches do not work well with short pieces,
  i.e. with wood pieces containing only a few annual rings.
  My new approach which I have developed in cooperation with Dr. Martin Raden
  and PD Dr. Hans-Peter Kahle, however, is different.
  It has been shown that it can accurately determine the date for even shorter wood pieces correctly.
  Therefore, it uses series of densities within a ring.
  By this it becomes one of the most accurate, existing approaches in dendrochronology, today!

  Information about how this grandiose approach works,
  you see below in the presentation which I held on the fifth of September 2018.
