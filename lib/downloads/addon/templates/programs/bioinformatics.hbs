  I have implemented with JavaScript and
  the <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knockout</a> framework
  visually more elaborate versions of algorithms known in Bioinformatics, when I studied computer science.
  The resulting project has been integrated in the RNA-Playground of
  <a href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> website.
</p>

<p class="content">
  The project is also available on GitHub,
  such that if you like you can play around, download and extend it like you want.
  In the video below, you will find all information you need, so details about the implementation
  and a live-presentation of the project.

  The software was written with the help of JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
